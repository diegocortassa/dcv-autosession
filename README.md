# Autosession for DCV
Autosession for DCV is a configuration script that creates a simple standalone Client Server architecture where the DCV sessions (console or virtual) life cycle is automatically managed without the need for additional running services, management interfaces, or servers.
The installation script should be idempotent and it can be executed many times with the same outcome, it is safe to put it in an ansible playbook.
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome!

NOTE: If login doesn't work with sssd + active directory change access_provider to simple in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

# Prerequisites
This script is intended for  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 or clones (Rocky Linux 9, AlmaLinux 9) and it assumes you have a graphical installation with the Gnome Desktop environment and GDM3 display manager, basically the "Workstation" or "Server with GUI" software selection during the OS installation.

It should be easy to adapt it to Ubuntu or other Linux distributions.

# Install
The preferred way is to use the rpm.
It can be manually installed via makefile with:
`make install`

To enable atuosession add `pam-service-name="dcv-autosession"` to the `[security]` section in /etc/dcv/dcv.conf

# Uninstall
If it was installed via rpm just remove the rpm launch.
If it was installef via `make install` it can be uninstalled with:
`make uninstall`

# How it works
When a user successfully logs in with the native or web client
- A pam_exec PAM module launches the dcv_autosessions.sh script
- the dcv_autosessions.sh script
    - If no session exists it creates a dynamic virtual or console (configurable) session
    - If the same user session is already running reconnect it
    - If another user session is running it asks the logged-in user to accept a collaboration with two options:
        - View only, where the collaborator will only see the user screen
        - Full control where the collaborator will be able to interact with the desktop

## Releases

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish releases. When a new version is ready:

1. Update the VERSION file with the new version number
2. Commit all changes
3. Create and push a new tag:
```bash
git tag v$(cat VERSION)
git push origin v$(cat VERSION)
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Create a source tarball (.tar.gz)
- Build RPM packages
- Create a GitHub release with all assets attached
- Generate release notes from commits

The following assets will be available in each release:
- Source code (tar.gz)
- RPM package for RHEL/CentOS/Fedora


# Credits
The dcv_collab_prompt.sh script was taken from https://github.com/NISP-GmbH/DCV-Management-Linux and slightly modified

# TODO
- A virtual session login does not update wtmp/utmp (last, who, and w commands do not work) dcvpamhelper does not seem to call PAM for session.
- google-chrome-stable-135.0.7049.84-1.x86_64 seg faults in virtual session even with "--disable-gpu" 
- google-chrome-stable-122.0.6261.128-1.x86_64 and google-chrome-stable-131.0.6778.139-1.x86_64 work ok
